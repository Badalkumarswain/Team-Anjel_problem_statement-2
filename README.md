Project Description

Eco Loop is a smart and sustainable waste management system designed for school and college campuses. The project focuses on solving the problem of mixed waste and poor segregation by introducing source-level waste segregation using color-coded bins and *QR-code-based tracking. When users dispose of waste and scan the QR code, their contribution to the bin’s waste level is recorded, and they receive monetary credits as incentives*, encouraging responsible behavior.

All waste data is stored in a centralized digital system that allows campus authorities to monitor waste levels and manage collection efficiently. Segregated waste is then processed through composting or authorized recycling, creating a closed-loop circular system. Eco Loop is **low-cost, scalable, and easy to implement*, promoting cleaner campuses, environmental awareness, and active student participation.
